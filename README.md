# PointGetter

For Microsoft Rewards!

Compile the code like you do with regular java (maven)

Lastly, open Edge and set your DevRools (CTRL+SHIFT+I) to the "mobile mode", I use the Galaxy S20 mode.

To get the search points every day, run the jar in the command line (java -jar PointGetter.jar) and focus on a new tab, then let the program do its job!
