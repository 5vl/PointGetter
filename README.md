# PointGetter

For Microsoft Rewards!

Compile the code like you do with regular java (maven)

Lastly, open Edge and set your DevRools (CTRL+SHIFT+I) to the "mobile mode", I use the Galaxy S20 mode.

To get the search points every day, run the jar in the command line (java -jar PointGetter.jar) and focus on a new tab, then let the program do its job!

Please note that it is not optimized *at all* as it was supposed to be for personal use only, but some friends wanted to use it was well so I made it public. Feel free to make pull requests!
